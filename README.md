#   Informatics Museum Collection Management Application

This repository contains a Flutter application designed to manage the collection of an informatics museum. It provides a centralized tool for cataloging, organizing, and managing museum objects, facilitating consultation, exhibition creation, and acquisition tracking.

##   Features

* **Comprehensive Cataloging:** Detailed recording of every object within the collection.
* **Logical Organization:** Organization of objects by category (e.g., Hardware, Publications) and subcategories (e.g., Computer, Peripherals, Books, Magazines).
* **Exhibit Grouping Management:** Creation and management of conceptual groupings of objects for exhibition purposes.
* **Acquisition Tracking:** Recording and management of information related to the acquisition of new objects.
* **Efficient Search and Filtering:** Advanced search and filtering functionalities to quickly locate objects.
* **Flexibility and Scalability:** Designed to adapt to future collection expansions.

##   Technology

* Flutter
* Hive (for local database)

##   Important Note

Please be aware that a significant portion of the codebase in this repository was either developed with the assistance of Vibecoding or generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). While these tools have been instrumental in the development process, it's important to review and understand the code.

##   Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Ensure you have Flutter installed.
3.  Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
4.  Run the application using `flutter run`.

##   Application Overview

The application uses a bottom navigation bar to navigate between the following main screens:

* **Objects:** Displays a list of museum objects with search and filter functionality.
* **Exhibit Groupings:** Manages groupings of objects for exhibits.
* **Acquisitions:** Manages records of object acquisitions.
* **Categories:** Manages categories and subcategories for objects.

##   Data Model

The application uses the following data models:

* **MuseumObject:** Represents an object in the museum's collection.
* **Category:** Represents a category for museum objects (e.g., Hardware, Publications).
* **Subcategory:** Represents a subcategory for museum objects (e.g., Computer, Peripherals, Books, Magazines).
* **ExhibitGrouping:** Represents a grouping of objects for an exhibit.
* **Acquisition:** Represents an acquisition of objects by the museum.
* **Location:** Represents a physical location within the museum.

##   Code Highlights

* **Data Persistence:** Hive is used for local data storage.
* **Demo Data:** The application initializes with demo data for testing and demonstration purposes.
* **Object Filtering:** The `_filterObjects` method in `ObjectsScreenState` demonstrates how objects are filtered based on search queries, categories, and subcategories.
* **Pagination:** The `ObjectsScreenState` implements pagination to handle large lists of objects.
